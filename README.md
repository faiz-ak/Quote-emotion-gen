### 🌱 Branching Strategy

Before starting your task, create your own branch from `main`:

```bash
### for Creation of branch

git checkout -b feature/<area>-<task>-<yourname>
Example:
git checkout -b feature/frontend-header-faizan

### ✅ After Completing Your Part

- Commit and push your changes to your branch.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch.
- Mention the work you’ve done in the PR description.
- Assign reviewers for code review.
- Wait for approval before merging.

### 🔄 Keep Your Branch Updated

To avoid merge conflicts, regularly update your branch with the latest `main` changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch-name
git merge main
